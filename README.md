# PaperclipGoogledrive [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/evinsou/paperclip-googledrive)

PaperclipGoogledrive is a gem that extends paperclip storage for Google Drive. Works with Rails 3.x.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'paperclip-googledrive'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install paperclip-googledrive

## Google Drive Setup

Google Drive is a free service for file storage files. In order to use this storage you have to create oauth 2.0 client in [Google APIs console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and authorize access to Google Drive account.

After creating your app, it will have an Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URL. Get auth scope for drive [Google Drive scopes](https://developers.google.com/drive/scopes). You need these for the authorization Rake task:
```
$ rake google_drive:authorize
```
When you call this Rake task, it will ask you to provide the client id, client secret, redirect url and auth scope. Afterwards it will present you with an authorize url on Google Drive. Simply go to that url, authorize the app, then enter code from url in the console. The rake task will output valid ruby code which you can use to create a client.

## Configuration

Example:
```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
 has_attached_file :photo,
    :storage => :google_drive,
    :google_drive_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/google_drive.yml"
end
```
The `:google_drive_credentials` option

This can be a hash or path to a YAML file containing the keys listed in the example below. These are obtained from your Google Drive app settings and the authorization Rake task.

Example `config/google_drive.yml`:
```erb
client_id: <%= ENV["CLIENT_ID"] %>
client_secret: <%= ENV["CLIENT_SECRET"] %>
access_token: <%= ENV["ACCESS_TOKEN"] %>
refresh_token: <%= ENV["REFRESH_TOKEN"] %>
```
It is good practice to not include the credentials directly in the YAML file. Instead you can set them in environment variables and embed them with ERB.

## Options

The `:google_drive_options` option

This is a hash containing any of the following options:
 - `:path` â€“ block, works similarly to Paperclip's `:path` option
 - `:folder_id`- id of folder that must be created in google drive and set public permessions on it
 - `:default_image` - an image in Public folder that used for attachemnts if attachement is not present

The :path option should be a block that returns a path that the uploaded file should be saved to. The block yields the attachment style and is executed in the scope of the model instance. For example:
```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :photo,
    :storage => :google_drive,
    :google_drive_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/google_drive.yml",
    :styles => { :medium => "300x300" },
    :google_drive_options => {
      :path => proc { |style| "#{style}_#{id}_#{photo.original_filename}" }
    }
end
```
For example, a new product is created with the ID of 14, and a some_photo.jpg as its photo. The following files would be saved to the Google Drive:

Public/14_some_photo.jpg
Public/14_some_photo_medium.jpg

The another file is called some_photo_medium.jpg because style names (other than original) will always be appended to the filenames, for better management.
